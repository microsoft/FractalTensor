# Program Neural Network with FractalTensor

FractalTensor is a programming framework that introduces a novel approach to organizing data in deep neural networks (DNNs) as a list of lists of statically-shaped tensors, referred to as a FractalTensor. It supports advanced functional list operations, including array compute operators inherited from second-order array combinators (SOACs) such as map, reduce, and scan, as well as first-order array access operators. These high-level operators can be applied to process the nested structure of FractalTensor variables, explicitly revealing opportunities for exploiting nested data parallelism and access locality through automatic compiler analysis.

As illustrated, the FractalTensor framework consists of three components that can function independently. We have separated these components into individual projects: (1) the front-end programming interface (in this repository), (2) [the intermediate representation (IR)](https://github.com/TiledTensor/TiledLower), and (3) a tile processing library called [TileFusion]( https://github.com/microsoft/TileFusion), which we developed to elevate CUDA Câ€™s level of abstraction for processing tiles.

FractalTensor is not currently under active refactoring and development.
